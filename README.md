# LangGraph Journey

Set of examples developed in langgraph to learn more about this library.


## Example 1


```
The GraphState will be created with a TypeDict and have a single entry point and an edge to the end node.

It will consist of a single key "count" with an initial value of 0.

The Developer node will increment the count by 1 and return the state.

We will add memory to the graph to save the state of the graph.

Then, we will create a visualization of the graph.

Finally, we will run the graph and print the result.
```
